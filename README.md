# LEARN CS

## Purpose
Though I am **very** thankful for my programming bootcamp experience, I know my education in CS was just scratching the surface. There are many fundamental concepts and topics in which I have just a rudimentary understanding of. 95% of the time my basic understanding was all I needed, yet these occurrences were always a reminder of the education I've been missing.

So that's where this repo comes into play. I will be following a traditional CS undergraduate curriculum outlined below. This will give me the missing pieces I need to take me to the next level in my career.

## Outline
The curriculum is based off of the [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com) and covers the following subjects:

**Note:** _The goal is to spend 100 - 200 hours per subject._

  - [ ] Programming
  - [ ] Computer Architecture
  - [ ] Algorithms and Data Structures
  - [ ] Math for CS
  - [ ] Operating Systems
  - [ ] Computer Networking
  - [ ] Databases
  - [ ] Languages and Compilers
  - [ ] Distributed Systems

[Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com) is made up of recommended textbooks and MOOC video series per subject.

This curriculum was built by The Bradfield School of Computer Science, and is specially tailored to self-taught software engineers and bootcamp graduates like myself.

I will cover the actual contents of each subject module, and will likely find additional resources to learn on top of the recommended ones.

# Goals

- [ ] Complete this guide in 2 years (or less)
 - _Estimated Completion Date August 2020_
- [ ] Fulfill prerequisites to get into a CS Grad Program if that's something I want at the time.
- [ ] Squash that thought in the back of my head that `Bootcamp Grad < CS Grad`
- [ ] **Document**, **Blog**, and **Build** things that I learn through out this process.
- [ ] Keep evolving this repo, and let others use it as a template for their own self-taught journey.
